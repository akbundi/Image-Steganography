#Image  Steganography

This repository is build by Abhinav Kabra in collaboration with Vishakha on "Image steganography" which refers to hiding information i.e. text, images or audio files in another image or video files. 
The current project aims to use steganography for an text with another image using PIL and we have also added video file to see the working of project's code.
 App of Project also added to run it directly.
- Developed and implemented a user interface featuring two options: "Insert" and "Extract"
- Utilized Python, PIL, and tkinter libraries to create an interactive interface
- Implemented the "Insert" functionality to hide a text file behind an image by specifying the image location, text file, key, and location of the newly formed image
- Designed the "Extract" functionality to retrieve hidden messages by only providing the image location and key
